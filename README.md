# Sentiment_Analysis

In this notebook, we will build explote multiple ways of sentiment Analysis on a part of [IMDb movie reviews dataset](https://keras.io/datasets/#imdb-movie-reviews-sentiment-classification). This dataset is built-in in Keras. We will begin by investigating the dataset that will be used to train and evaluate our models.

## Sentiment Analysis using Neural Netwroks

### What you should already know
- neural networks, forward and back-propagation
- stochastic gradient descent
- mean squared error
- and train/test splits

After pre-processing the data We will start with a basic neural network and then keep on improving the model by trying various techniques like reducing neural noise from the input data, preventing the network inefficienies and eliminating unnecessary calculations.

## Sentiment Analysis using Recurrent Neural Netwroks

### What you should already know
- RNN,
- LSTM

In this section we will use Recurrent Neural Network, specifically LSTM to perform sentiment analysis in Keras.
